# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

This is my implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in Rust.

At the time of commit the active version was `Version 4.0.1, 2024-08-31`.

I went through this to learn more about graphics as well as Rust.
